## Lottery covering spreads utilising Fano planes

An attempt to maximise the probability of drawing 3 numbers in a single NZ Lotto draw using a custom Fano plane class, based on the <url=https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/how-many-lottery-tickets-do-you-need-to-buy-to-guarantee-a-win-manchesters-mathematicians-find-the-answer/>work</url> of Dr David Stewart and Dr David Cushing at the University of Manchester.

Absolutely does <ins>not</ins> guarantee a win, but averages around 10% better odds than a random ticket ("lucky dip"). Further optimisation of pairs/triples may improve odds slightly, but random is random and 21 lines isn't a lot of space to work with!
